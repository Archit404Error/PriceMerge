                    <div style = "height: 2vh;"></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Demand for items during the COVID 19 pandemic has risen drastically, and so, naturally, products are selling out faster
                        and prices are beginning to rise. This means consumers often lose money on transactions, and so we built PriceMerge to help these people
                        instantly compare prices and save money. The fact that we also email users when prices drop means that they never have to worry about missing out
                        on deals.</li>
                        <div style = "height: 2vh;"></div>
                        <li>Many companies may also try and implement price gouging tactics, where they intentionally raise prices to make a profit, because
                        they know everybody will buy a certian product(this is illegal). This is very hard for the government to track, and so PriceMerge
                        also helps to combat against this practice and rewards sites that do not price gouge by showing our visitors products from these sites.</li>
                        <div style = "height: 2vh;"></div>
                        <li>Even disregarding the Coronavirus pandemic, PriceMerge is still a very strong solution for price comparisons online, as not only
                        do other price comparison websites track your data and sell it, which PriceMerge will never do, but our website also alerts users automatically
                        when prices they're tracking drop, a feature unique to our site. Hence, we are helping users save money through price comparisons,
                        while simultaneously implementing innovative features to help you find the best deals!</li>
